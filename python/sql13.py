Task:
Write a SQL query to list the names of all people who starred in a movie in which Kevin Bacon also starred.
Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each person.
There may be multiple people named Kevin Bacon in the database. Be sure to only select the Kevin Bacon born in 1958.
Kevin Bacon himself should not be included in the resulting list.

Find the ID of Kevin Bacon (the one born in 1958!)
Find the IDs of movies associated with Kevin Baconâ€™s ID
Find the IDs of people associated with those movie IDs
Find the names of people with those people IDs

results in a table with 1 column and 182 rows.
