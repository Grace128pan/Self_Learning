/*
page 149 exercise 3 array:
program 6.2 only allows 20 responses to be entered, modify the program so that any number of responses can be entered. 
So that the users does not have to count the number of responses in the list, set up the program so that the value 999 can
be keyed in by the user to indicate that the last response has been entered.(hint: you can use break statement
if you want to exit your loop.)
