#python3.13.0 updated, minor changes  python.org to access it 
# Lists and Tuples

#lists
#Ordered
#Mutable(can change individual members!) unlike characters in strings
#Dynamic size - can change the size of the list itself, unlike strings which are fixed
#Comma separated between brackets [1,3,2,5,6,2]
#Can have duplicates
#Can be nested - can have list inside list and so on
#Can use same syntax for slicing and indexing as in strings
# in other words it is a generic container for whatever you want to store in computer memory
groceries=['Bread','Eggs','Milk'] # define my list and I will store 3 strings inside
print(groceries)
print(type(groceries))

emptylist = [] # often used to initialize before storing things inside a list
# name emptylist could be any valid variable name
print(len(emptylist))

# checking for existance
# if we have many items in a list this will take so called O(n) time
# meaning if we have million items Python will have to check every single one
# there is another structure for this which is more efficient
print('Bread' in groceries)  #check existance of an item in a list

food = "My breadsticks" # compare with string membership
print("bread" in food) #true
print("bread" in groceries) # case sensitive
print(" bread " in food) #good for exact match

# we can call a list conversion a a string (or other sequence types)
# remember we had int, float, bool and str conversion
name_list = list("Valdis")
print(name_list) #the result would be a list of characters

print(list(food))  #we can convert a string to a list of characters using list() function

# so range is actually a lazy factory for numbers
# in computer programming lazy is usually more efficient than eager(meaning runs immediately)
# we need to call list to convert this force this lazy factory actually run the numbers
numbers = list(range(12)) # so this will have numbers from 0 to 11

#tuples
#Immutable(can not change individual members!)   count and index methods
#Dynamic size - can not change the size of the tuple itself
#Comma separated between parentheses (1,3,2,5,6,2) or comma separated without parentheses 1,3,2,5,6,2
#immutable lists
#Can have duplicates
#Can be nested - can have tuple inside tuple and so on

#Philosophy speaking:
#tuples are for heterogenous data - meaning different types
#lists are for homogenous data - same types(numbers, strings etc)
#This rule is not a guideline not a strict one
number_tuples = tuple(range(5,18))  # notice the round regular parenthesis (not square brackets used by list!)

# in many languages you would have to use a temporary 3rd variable
print(a, b)

print(a, b)

# One last thing on tuples, the values inside can be mutated but not changed
# if we have something with IN PLACE methods inside tuple we can use those
